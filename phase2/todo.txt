    Zhan

Part 2: add the following feature
    Killed-invoked
    + Make sure you can demo time-sensitive features, like adding interest to savings accountRequests each month.
        - out a file that contains update info of inetest

    Seel - TODO
    + Improve the manager "undo" functionality. There is more than one way to interpret this statement. For example, you could have unlimited undo capability for the manager, or the ability to specify a number n so that the system undoes n transactions on an account, or you could have undo functionality for a user's previous n transactions (as opposed to an account's previous transactions). You can interpret this statement in any reasonable way that is as complex as the above suggestions.
        - undo: improve functionality by add "batch undo"
            - given a transactiona

    Joyce - TODO i thought this was one by seel?
    + Refactor so that you can have joint user accountRequests where two distinct users can both withdraw, deposit, and check the balance on the same account.
        -  plz implement into action handler

    Seel - DONE
    + transaction Manager:
        - show all the history
        - give id, pull all the history
        - undo transactions
        - undo a random transaction
        todo
        - plz implement them
